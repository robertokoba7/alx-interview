# 0x01. Lockboxes
---
The approach to solving this problem would involve implementing a variation of a depth-first search or breadth-first search algorithm to traverse the graph represented by the boxes and their corresponding keys. The algorithm would start from the first box (boxes[0]) and attempt to open all the boxes that it has keys for, marking them as visited. It would then try to open any unvisited boxes that were opened by the previous boxes and repeat the process until all boxes have been visited.
The concept being tested in this question is the ability to write efficient and effective algorithms for graph traversal, as well as the ability to work with data structures such as lists and nested lists.
